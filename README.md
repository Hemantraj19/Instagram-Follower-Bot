# Instagram Follower Bot

This is a simple Python script using Selenium to automate the process of logging into Instagram, visiting the followers of a specified account, and following them.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed
- Chrome browser installed
- ChromeDriver installed (ensure it's compatible with your Chrome version)
- Selenium library installed (`pip install selenium`)

## Configuration

1. Open the script (`instagram_follower_bot.py`) in a text editor.
2. Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your Instagram credentials.
3. Update `SIMILAR_ACCOUNT` with the username of the account whose followers you want to follow.

## Usage

1. Run the script: `python main.py`.
2. The script will open a Chrome browser, log in to your Instagram account, and navigate to the followers of the specified account.
3. It will start following the followers.

## Important Notes

- Avoid running the script too often to prevent bot-like behavior.
- The script may need adjustments over time due to changes in Instagram's website structure.
